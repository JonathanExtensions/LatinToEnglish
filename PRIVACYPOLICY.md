Chaotic Collection Master Set: Privacy policy

This is an Android app developed by myself, Jonathan.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge. Which is why I wanted both a) the app to be fully functional offline, once downloaded all resources for the app are in the app. b) I wanted to create an app that has no ads, always will be free, and has no bloatware or tracking, or permissions needed. Just a clean app with images to keep track of your collection.

Data collected by the app (There isn't any)
I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences like cards or images) are stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.
All Images and Cards belong to the owner of the Chaotic TCG (and/or the artist that drew them, not entirely sure who has the rights). The game has been dead for over 14 years now. But I do not own these images/cards/or the chaotic tcg. This was done as a passion project for the community.

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the AndroidManifest.xml file:


If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
